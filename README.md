# Chronic Kidney Disease Detection

This project aims to build and evaluate a machine learning model for the early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical data. The project is split into two main notebooks: training and testing.

## Project Structure

- `kidney_disease_training.ipynb`: This notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and performance evaluation.
- `kidney_disease_testing.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on loading the trained model and testing it on unseen data to evaluate its generalization capabilities.

## Features

- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Feature selection and encoding
- Multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Final testing on separate dataset
