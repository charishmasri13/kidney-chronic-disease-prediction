# 🩺 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Detection

A machine learning-based project to detect Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical and laboratory data. This project includes notebooks for training and testing predictive models to assist with early disease detection.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects kidney function over time and can lead to kidney failure if not diagnosed early. This project uses supervised machine learning models to classify whether a patient has CKD based on various medical attributes.

Key functionalities include:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Training multiple classification models
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Saving and reusing the trained model
- Testing on unseen data

## 📁 Files Included

- `kidney_disease_training.ipynb` – Notebook for preprocessing data, training models, evaluating results, and saving the best model using `joblib`.
- `kidney_disease_testing.ipynb` – Notebook for loading the trained model and testing it on new, unseen data.
